# elemental
Inject reusable, foreign HTML elements into the DOM. 

## Why Use Elemental?
Elemental removes the need for storing reusable HTML elements as strings or
resting in the DOM. Now, you can store all of your reusable elements in a single
file and quickly inject the needed ones into your window.
